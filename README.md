__The Consumer Healthcare Project__ is focused on building __an eCommerce Analytics report__ to evaluate sales performance across various regions, with a blend of _online_ and _offline_ data. 

### Hereâ€™s an outline of the project:

## Objective
- __Develop a Comprehensive eCommerce Report:__ The primary goal is to analyze the sales data in-depth across multiple sales channels (e.g., e-commerce and physical stores).
- __Integrate Additional Data from New Markets:__ This involves manually adding data for several countries to cover both online and offline channels, allowing for an expanded view of sales trends.

## Data Structure

The dataset includes detailed columns related to geography, product categorization, sales channels, and performance metrics. _Key fields include:_

- Region: Represents geographical divisions (e.g., AMEA).
- Channel: Defines sales channels (e.g., E-COMMERCE, OFFLINE).
- Category Hierarchies (Category1 - Category5): Defines the product categories and sub-categories.
- Corporation Groups: Grouped by corporation for brand-level analysis.
- Product Group: Hierarchical product classification, from ProductGroup1 to ProductGroup3.
- Sales Metrics: Includes PeriodSales, which reflects monthly sales figures, and PACK, which measures the number of product packs sold.
- Reference Products and Markets: For comparative analysis (e.g., ReferenceMarketA and ReferenceMarketB).
- Time Periods: Includes EndDate and LaunchDate for sales trends over time.

## Project Workflow
- Data Integration: Combining existing data with new country-level data for both e-commerce and offline performance, structured to allow deeper analysis at regional, channel, and product levels.
- Report Building: Leveraging this data to create an analytics report that provides insights into product performance, segmented by region, channel, and other defined metrics.

The detailed fields provide granular control for sales analysis, enabling targeted insights into performance across channels and product segments. The eCommerce Analytics report will allow tracking sales trends, identifying growth opportunities, and understanding the product performance landscape in new and existing markets.

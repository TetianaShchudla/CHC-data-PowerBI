__The Consumer Healthcare Project__ is focused on building __an eCommerce Analytics report__ to evaluate sales performance across various regions, with a blend of _online_ and _offline_ data. 

### Hereâ€™s an outline of the project:

## Objective
- __Develop a Comprehensive eCommerce Report:__ The primary goal is to analyze the sales data in-depth across multiple sales channels (e.g., e-commerce and physical stores).
- __Integrate Additional Data from New Markets:__ This involves manually adding data for several countries to cover both online and offline channels, allowing for an expanded view of sales trends.

## Data Structure

The dataset consists of detailed columns related to geography, product categorization, sales channels, and performance metrics, providing multiple layers of segmentation:

- Region: High-level geographical segments such as 'AMEA', 'CHINA', and 'EULA', each representing a broader market region.
- Zone: Further subdivision within each region, including values like 'AUSTRALIA/NZ', 'BRAZIL', 'CHINA + HK + TAIWAN + CROSS BORDER', and 'CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE', enabling more localized analysis.
- Cluster: Defined clusters such as 'CHC', which group data according to specific market or product clusters within certain regions.
- Country: Lists specific countries such as 'AUSTRALIA', 'BRAZIL', 'GERMANY', and 'ITALY', facilitating country-level analysis and comparison.
- Channel: Differentiates distribution channels, including 'E-COMMERCE', 'MASS MARKET', 'PHARMACY', and 'HOSPITAL', which helps in understanding sales distribution across different sales modes.
- Category Hierarchies:
- Category5: Strategic classifications like 'OTHERS', 'STRONGHOLDS', 'SUSTAINS', 'FUTURE HERO', and 'MUST WIN' represent product or market priorities.
- Category4: Broad product classifications, including 'SANOFI-CHC', 'SANOFI-NON-CHC', and 'NON SANOFI-CHC', distinguishing products by brand affiliation.
- Category3: Therapeutic groupings like 'COUGH & COLD', 'DIGESTIVE HEALTH', and 'PAIN CARE', allowing segmentation by product usage.
- Category2: Further sub-categories like 'COUGH, COLD & FLU', 'DIGESTIVE WELLNESS', and 'MENTAL WELLNESS', which provide more specific categorization.
- Category1: Specific treatment-based segments, such as 'COLD/FLU', 'IMMUNITY', 'SLEEP', and 'MOBILITY', adding detailed product classification.
- Corporation Groups: Brand-level classification, including major corporations such as 'SANOFI', 'GSK+PFZ', and 'J&J', which enables competitive analysis.
- Product Group: Hierarchical product classification ranging from ProductGroup1 to ProductGroup3, to facilitate focused product performance insights.
- Sales Metrics: Key performance metrics, including PeriodSales (reflecting monthly sales) and PACK (measuring units sold), provide quantitative sales insights.
- Reference Products and Markets: Provides comparative fields, such as ReferenceMarketA and ReferenceMarketB, allowing for competitive or benchmark analysis.
- Time Periods: Dates like EndDate and LaunchDate track product performance and sales trends over time.


## Project Workflow
- _Data Integration:_ Combining existing data with new country-level data for both e-commerce and offline performance, structured to allow deeper analysis at regional, channel, and product levels.
- _Report Building:_ Leveraging this data to create an analytics report that provides insights into product performance, segmented by region, channel, and other defined metrics.

The detailed fields provide granular control for sales analysis, enabling targeted insights into performance across channels and product segments. The eCommerce Analytics report will allow tracking sales trends, identifying growth opportunities, and understanding the product performance landscape in new and existing markets.
